## Architecture

The URL Redirection Tracking System is built using a serverless architecture on AWS, designed for high availability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. The system processes URL redirection requests while capturing comprehensive analytics data for business intelligence.

![Main Architecture](docs/architecture/url-redirection-architecture.png)

### System Overview

The architecture consists of three main Lambda functions working together:

1. **Redirection Lambda**: Handles incoming URL redirection requests with real-time validation
2. **Tracking Lambda**: Processes tracking data asynchronously via SQS for reliable data persistence
3. **Analytics Lambda**: Provides RESTful API endpoints for querying and aggregating tracking data

### Core Infrastructure Components

- **API Gateway (Regional)**: Entry point for all HTTP requests with built-in throttling
- **AWS WAF**: Web application firewall providing security protection and rate limiting
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute functions for business logic processing
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database with Global Secondary Indexes for efficient querying
- **SQS FIFO Queue**: Message queue ensuring ordered, exactly-once processing
- **CloudWatch**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting system

### Data Flow Architecture

![Data Flow](docs/architecture/url-redirection-dataflow.png)

The request processing follows this flow:

1. **User Request**: Client sends GET request with URL and optional source attribution
2. **Security Layer**: AWS WAF filters malicious traffic and enforces rate limits
3. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate Lambda functions
4. **Validation**: Redirection Lambda validates URL format and allowed domains
5. **Tracking Generation**: Creates tracking data with UUID, timestamp, and client information
6. **Async Processing**: Sends tracking message to SQS FIFO queue for reliable processing
7. **Data Persistence**: Tracking Lambda batch processes messages and stores in DynamoDB
8. **User Response**: Returns 302 redirect response to client

### Monitoring & Observability

![Monitoring Architecture](docs/architecture/monitoring-architecture.png)

The system includes comprehensive monitoring with:

- **13+ CloudWatch Alarms** monitoring errors, latency, and system health
- **Structured JSON Logging** with correlation IDs for request tracing
- **Performance Metrics** for all components (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS)
- **SNS Notifications** for critical alerts
- **Health Check Endpoints** for system status monitoring

### Key Architectural Features

#### Security
- **Domain Validation**: Only allows redirections to authorized domains (amazonaws.cn, amazonaws.com, amazon.com)
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests per 5-minute window per IP address
- **API Key Protection**: Analytics endpoints require authentication
- **WAF Protection**: SQL injection, XSS, and known bad inputs filtering

#### Reliability
- **FIFO Queue Processing**: Ensures ordered message processing with deduplication
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Handles failed messages with retry logic (max 3 attempts)
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: DynamoDB backup for data protection
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of up to 25 DynamoDB writes per batch

#### Performance
- **Global Secondary Indexes**: Optimized queries by source attribution and timestamp
- **Pay-per-Request Billing**: DynamoDB scales automatically with demand
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connections in Lambda functions
- **Long Polling**: SQS reduces empty receives and improves cost efficiency

#### Scalability
- **Serverless Architecture**: Automatically scales based on demand
- **Regional Deployment**: Currently deployed in ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo)
- **Concurrent Execution Limits**: Controlled DynamoDB write capacity usage
- **Message Grouping**: FIFO queue groups by client IP for parallel processing

## Security

### Access Control

- API Gateway endpoints are protected by AWS WAF
- Analytics endpoints (`/analytics/*`) and health endpoints (`/health*`) require API key authentication via `X-API-Key` header
- Redirection endpoints (`/{proxy+}`) are publicly accessible
- Rate limiting prevents abuse (10 requests per 5-minute window per IP)

### Data Protection

- All data is encrypted at rest in DynamoDB
- Data in transit is encrypted using TLS
- IP addresses are collected for analytics but can be anonymized if required

### Allowed Domains

The system only allows redirections to these domains:
- `amazonaws.cn`
- `amazonaws.com`
- `amazon.com`

### WAF Protection

- SQL injection protection
- XSS protection
- Known bad inputs protection
- Rate limiting by IP address

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Frontend Build Issues

If you encounter linting or test failures during frontend build, here are the solutions:

**Linting Issues:**
- Most linting warnings about `any` types are acceptable for chart libraries and can be ignored
- Critical errors (like syntax errors) should be fixed before deployment
- You can run `npm run lint -- --fix` in the frontend directory to auto-fix many issues

**Test Failures:**
- Some tests may fail due to environment differences or missing dependencies
- For production deployment, you can temporarily skip tests: `./scripts/build-frontend.sh --skip-tests`
- However, it's recommended to fix failing tests for code quality

**Node.js Version Compatibility:**
- The frontend uses Vite 7.0.6 which requires Node.js ^20.19.0 or >=22.12.0
- If you see engine warnings, consider updating Node.js or use `--force` flag: `npm install --force`

**Build Script Options:**
The build script supports several flags to handle common issues:
```bash
# Skip linting (for quick builds)
./scripts/build-frontend.sh --skip-lint

# Skip tests (for deployment with known test issues)
./scripts/build-frontend.sh --skip-tests

# Skip both (fastest build, use with caution)
./scripts/build-frontend.sh --skip-lint --skip-tests

# Clean build (removes previous build artifacts)
./scripts/build-frontend.sh --clean
```

#### CDK Version Compatibility

If you encounter CDK schema version mismatch errors during deployment:

1. Update CDK CLI to the latest version: `npm install -g aws-cdk@latest`
2. Verify version compatibility: `cdk --version` (should be 2.1020.2 or later)
3. Clear CDK cache if needed: `cdk context --clear`

#### Test Failures During Deployment

If tests fail during deployment:

1. Run tests individually to identify issues: `npm test -- --verbose`
2. Use `--skip-tests` flag for deployment if tests are not critical: `./scripts/deploy.sh --skip-tests`
3. Check mock configurations in test files, especially import order for AWS SDK mocks

#### High DLQ Message Count

1. Check DLQ messages: `./scripts/monitor-dlq.sh list`
2. Analyze message patterns: `./scripts/monitor-dlq.sh analyze`
3. Reprocess valid messages: `./scripts/reprocess-messages.sh`

#### Lambda Function Errors

1. Check CloudWatch logs for error details
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Check DynamoDB table permissions
4. Verify SQS queue permissions

#### High Latency

1. Check DynamoDB performance metrics
2. Review Lambda function memory allocation
3. Analyze query patterns for optimization opportunities

### Performance Optimization

- Use DynamoDB Global Secondary Indexes for efficient queries
- Implement connection pooling for database connections
- Optimize Lambda memory allocation based on usage patterns
- Use SQS batching for improved throughput
